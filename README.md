The author of this script would like to be able to predict the probability of certain words being mistranslated by a
machine translation engine. For information security reasons, the actual words themselves cannot be used in making
predictions. Instead, predictions must be made using the derived features contained in `raw_data.csv`.

The author wrote this script to train some simple models on their data, but the prediction accuracy for new data isn't
nearly as good as expected based on the R^2 scores generated.

Please do the following:

* Demonstrate how you would explore the data
* Improve upon the data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and model selection provided in the code
* Suggest next steps (ex. additional data collection, refactoring, other ML models) you would experiment with to improve the code and results
* Explain possible reasons for the bad predictions from the original code

Note:

* Do not modify the file `raw_data.csv`
